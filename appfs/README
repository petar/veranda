# DEPLOYING APPFS
# ===============

# Prepare a new password file
mkpass $USER $PASSWORD > .password

APP=maymounkov-org

# All host specs after -h below, must refer to the *.appspot.com name of the site, not their custom domain.
# Using the latter produces SSL certificate errors.

# Make the file system on the APPFS server
appfile -h $APP.appspot.com -u dummy -p dummy mkfs

# Replace the default password file
appfile -h $APP.appspot.com -u dummy -p dummy write /.password < .password

# Prepare a mount point for the APPFS locally
mkdir -p /mnt/appfs.$APP
umount /mnt/appfs.$APP

# The next step may not work right away, until AppEngine builds an index for the datasore
# You can monoitor the progress in the app console in Datastore Indexes

# Mount the APPFS locally
appmount -h $APP.appspot.com -u $USER -p $PASSWORD /mnt/appfs.$APP
cp -R $HOME/appfs.$APP/* /mnt/appfs.$APP/

# Optionally, unmount the local APPFS mount
umount /mnt/appfs.$APP
